# tableau-challenge

For this project, I created visualizations with Tableau to help city officials evalute the NYC CitiBike program. Three main ideas were explored: the impact of the pandemic, top station locations, and peak hours of use.

# The following key insights were revealed:
The number of rides taken on CitiBikes was most impacted in March 2020, right at the start of the pandemic with trips year of year down through the spring and summer months.  After the inital impact, the number of rides slowly increased month over month with rides in Sept 2020 outperforming Sept 2019. Average trip durations in the selected months were also higher overall in 2020 than in 2019.

The percent of users registered as subscribers decreased from 84.5% in 2019 to 80% in 2020. However, the overall number of riders increased from 2019 to 2020


What were the most popular start and end CitiBike stations in 2019-20?
Analysis revealed the pandemic had little affect on the station popularity with vast majority of locations being the same year of year

Top 3 Locations Overall:

Pershing Square North
12 Ave & W 40 St
West St & Chambers St

What were the peak hours for CitiBike riders in 2019-20?
Our analysis showed quite the shift in start time popularity in 2020, compared to 2019, as more people worked from home. Thus, not as many riders needing to start their trips at the 8-9am "rush hour", shifting start times later into the afternoon.

In 2020, despite the season, the peak start and end times are not as concentrated as they were in 2019 to commute times. The hours of the day users are starting and ending their rides shifted to be later in the day.
